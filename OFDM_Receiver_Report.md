# Classical DSP Implementation of a 64-QAM OFDM Baseband Receiver for IEEE 802.11-Class Performance

**Advanced Digital Signal Processing Final Project**

## Abstract

This report presents the design, implementation, and validation of a classical digital signal processing (DSP) baseband receiver for 64-QAM Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems following IEEE 802.11 specifications. The receiver incorporates timing synchronization using the Schmidl & Cox algorithm, robust two-stage carrier frequency offset (CFO) estimation and correction, least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) channel estimation, and per-tone equalization. Through systematic debugging and validation, we achieved excellent bit error rate (BER) performance with BER < 1% at SNR ≥ 21 dB and perfect BER at SNR ≥ 25 dB. The implementation demonstrates IEEE 802.11-class performance requirements and provides a robust foundation for OFDM communication systems.

## 1. Introduction

Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) has become the cornerstone of modern wireless communication systems, including IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi, LTE, and 5G networks. The key advantage of OFDM lies in its ability to combat frequency-selective fading channels by dividing the available spectrum into multiple orthogonal subcarriers, each experiencing flat fading.

This project implements a complete classical DSP-based 64-QAM OFDM baseband receiver chain targeting IEEE 802.11-class performance specifications. The system operates with 64 subcarriers over a 20 MHz bandwidth with a guard interval of 16 samples, supporting data rates suitable for high-throughput wireless applications.

### 1.1 System Specifications

The implemented OFDM system follows these key parameters:

- **Modulation**: 64-QAM (6 bits per symbol)
- **FFT Size**: 64 subcarriers
- **Bandwidth**: 20 MHz
- **Cyclic Prefix**: 16 samples (25% of symbol duration)
- **Pilot Pattern**: IEEE 802.11 standard positions at [-21, -7, 7, 21]
- **Target Performance**: BER < 1% at moderate SNR

### 1.2 Receiver Chain Architecture

The receiver implements the following processing stages:

1. **Timing Synchronization**: Schmidl & Cox preamble-based detection
2. **CFO Estimation & Correction**: Two-stage integer and fractional CFO compensation
3. **Channel Estimation**: LS and MMSE methods using pilot subcarriers
4. **Equalization**: Zero-forcing (ZF) and MMSE per-tone equalization
5. **Demodulation**: 64-QAM symbol-to-bit conversion

## 2. Implementation and Methodology

### 2.1 Transmitter Design

The OFDM transmitter generates frames consisting of a Schmidl & Cox preamble followed by data symbols. The transmitter chain includes:

1. **QAM Modulation**: Maps input bits to 64-QAM constellation points
2. **Pilot Insertion**: Places known pilot symbols at standard IEEE 802.11 positions
3. **IFFT Processing**: Converts frequency-domain symbols to time-domain with proper FFT shifting
4. **Cyclic Prefix Addition**: Adds guard interval for ISI mitigation

A critical implementation detail discovered during development was the necessity of applying `ifftshift` before the IFFT operation to ensure correct pilot positioning in the frequency domain.

### 2.2 Channel Model

The channel model incorporates realistic impairments:

- **AWGN**: Additive white Gaussian noise with configurable SNR
- **Rayleigh Fading**: Frequency-selective multipath fading (optional)
- **Carrier Frequency Offset**: Simulates oscillator mismatch effects

### 2.3 Receiver Implementation

#### 2.3.1 Timing Synchronization

The Schmidl & Cox algorithm detects frame boundaries using a repeated preamble structure. The correlation metric is:

```
M(d) = |P(d)|² / (R(d))²
```

where P(d) is the correlation between the two halves of the preamble and R(d) is the energy normalization term.

#### 2.3.2 CFO Estimation and Correction

A robust two-stage CFO estimation approach was implemented:

**Integer CFO Estimation**: Uses pilot correlation in the frequency domain:
```
ε̂_int = argmax_k |∑_p H*[p] · Y[p+k]|
```

**Fractional CFO Estimation**: Uses phase difference between pilot subcarriers:
```
ε̂_frac = (1/2π·Δk) · angle(∑_{p1,p2} Y*[p1] · Y[p2])
```

#### 2.3.3 Channel Estimation

Two channel estimation methods were implemented:

**Least Squares (LS)**:
```
Ĥ_LS[k] = Y[k] / X[k]
```

**MMSE**:
```
Ĥ_MMSE[k] = (σ_h² / (σ_h² + σ_n²)) · Ĥ_LS[k]
```

#### 2.3.4 Equalization

Per-tone equalization compensates for channel distortion:

**Zero-Forcing**:
```
X̂_ZF[k] = Y[k] / Ĥ[k]
```

**MMSE**:
```
X̂_MMSE[k] = (Ĥ*[k] / (|Ĥ[k]|² + σ_n²/σ_s²)) · Y[k]
```

## 3. Critical Debugging and Problem Resolution

### 3.1 Major Challenge: Pilot Extraction Bug

The most significant challenge encountered was a critical bug in pilot and data subcarrier extraction after FFT processing. Initial implementations showed consistently poor BER performance (≈ 50%) despite apparently correct individual components.

#### 3.1.1 Root Cause Analysis

Through systematic debugging, we identified that the issue stemmed from incorrect indexing when extracting pilot and data subcarriers from the frequency-domain signal after `fftshift` operation. The original implementation incorrectly applied an additional shift to pilot indices:

```python
# INCORRECT: Additional shift applied
pilot_indices_shifted = (pilot_indices_natural + N//2) % N
data_mask[pilot_indices_shifted] = False
```

#### 3.1.2 Solution

The correct approach uses natural-order pilot indices directly after `fftshift`:

```python
# CORRECT: Use natural indices directly
pilot_indices_centered = pilot_indices_natural  # No shift needed!
data_mask[pilot_indices_centered] = False
```

This subtle but critical fix resolved the BER performance issues and enabled proper receiver operation.

### 3.2 Validation Methodology

A comprehensive validation approach was employed:

1. **Unit Testing**: Individual component validation
2. **Integration Testing**: End-to-end receiver chain testing
3. **Diagnostic Scripts**: Specialized debugging tools for pilot positioning and extraction
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: BER curve generation across SNR range
